# RAE_leak_ias
This repository includes interesting information on the Spanish language as available in RAE web pages.

## Motivation
The Royal Spanish Academy, founded in 1713 on the initiative of Juan Manuel Fernández Pacheco y Zúñiga, Marquis of Villena, is an institution with its own legal personality whose main mission is to ensure that the changes experienced by the Spanish language in its constant adaptation to the needs of its speakers do not break the essential unity that it maintains throughout the Hispanic area, as established in the first article of its current statutes.

In accordance with this same text, the RAE must "also take care that this evolution preserves the genius of the language, as it has been consolidated over the centuries, as well as establishing and disseminating the criteria of ownership and correctness , and to contribute to its splendor. To achieve these ends, it will study and promote studies on the history and present of Spanish, it will disseminate literary writings, especially classical ones, and non-literary ones that it deems important for the knowledge of such issues, and it will try to keep alive the memory of those who, in Spain or in America, they have cultivated our language with glory». Likewise, the RAE, "as a member of the Association of Spanish Language Academies, will maintain a special relationship with the corresponding and associated academies". (Description taken from https://www.rae.es/la-institucion)

In these corporate paragraphs, nothing is said about its financing model. The reality is that the RAE is financed in a substantial part through the general State budget, and that it monopolizes special aid for R+D+i without attending public calls. This fact places it closer to being a public institution that should provide free services to the Spanish-speaking community.

This public service is carried out partially. Yes, it is possible to consult the Dictionary of the Spanish Language (DLE) online [here](https://dle.rae.es), and even have a sample of what's new when an update is published, but it is not possible to know the lemma list of the dictionary. Likewise, the textual corpus that it has been developing in recent years, CORPES XXI, can be consulted on its website [here](https://apps2.rae.es/CORPES), but again it is not possible to know the set of texts that comprise it.

This lack of transparency is what motivates this modest RAE_leak_ias (_relics_) repository with information that the RAE treasures and does not share with anyone.
